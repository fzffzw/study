假设有一个表(syslogs)有1000万条记录，需要在业务不
停止的情况下删除其中statusid=1的所有记录，差不多
有600万条， 直接执行 DELETE FROM syslogs WHERE statusid=1 
会发现删除失败，因为lock wait timeout exceed的错误。
 
因为这条语句所涉及的记录数太多，因此我们通过LIMIT参数
分批删除，比如每10000条进行一次删除，那么我们可以利用 
MySQL这样的语句来完成
 
DELETE FROM syslogs WHERE status=1 ORDER BY statusid LIMIT 10000;
然后分多次执行就可以把这些记录成功删除。
